'''You have a file directory with structure of:

.
└── files
    ├── students.csv
    └── grades.csv
The columns in students.csv:

Name   | Student_ID 
-------+------------
The columns in grades.csv:

ID    | Class   | Grade
------+---------+-------
The ID column in grades.csv corresponds to the Student_ID column in students.csv.

Task
Write under the folder files a csv named output.csv in the format below

Student_ID | Class
-----------+--------
The file should contain all instances of Student_ID and Class where a student that has a Name of student_name received the grade of grade.
Example 1
Input
students.csv:
Name   | Student_ID 
-------+------------
Bob    | 32155   
Ron    | 43226

ID    | Class   | Grade
------+---------+-------
32155 | English | A
32155 | History | B
32155 | Science | B
43226 | English | C

Useful Methods
Read The CSVs
Pandas has a method called read_csv, which reads in a csv
import pandas as pd


students_df = pd.read_csv('files/students.csv', index_col=False)
grades_df   = pd.read_csv('files/grades.csv'  , index_col=False)
for more info and optional arguments refer to https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html
Rename the columns
Pandas has a method to rename columns of DataFrames
df = df.rename(
  columns= {
    'Original Column Name 1': 'New Column Name 1',
    'Original Column Name 2': 'New Column Name 2',
    'Original Column Name 3': 'New Column Name 3'
    ...
  }
)

#Another valid way to accomplish this is to do the below, 
#this method makes it so you do not have reassign #df

df.rename(
  columns= {
    'Original Column Name 1': 'New Column Name 1',
    'Original Column Name 2': 'New Column Name 2',
    'Original Column Name 3': 'New Column Name 3'
    ...
  },
  inplace=True
)
for more info and optional arguments refer to https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.rename.html
Merge the DataFrames
Pandas has a method called merge that lets you merge 2 Pandas DataFrames
df_merged= df1.merge(
  df2,
  on= ['Column_Name_1', 'Column_Name_2', 'Column_Name_3', ...],
  how=, #'left' or 'right' or 'outer' or 'inner' or 'cross' 
        # the default value is 'inner'
)
for more info and optional arguments refer to https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.merge.html
Query the Merged DataFrame
Pandas has multiple ways to filter or query a dataframe

df_queried= df[
  df['Column_Name_1'] == 1
]
# returns a df with only rows with:
# Column_Name_1 equaling 1

df_queried= df[
  (  df['Column_Name_1'] == 1)
  & (df['Column_Name_2'] == 2)
]
# returns a df with only rows with:
# Column_Name_1 equaling 1 
# and Column_Name_2 equaling 2

df_queried= df[
  (  df['Column_Name_1'] == 1)
  | (df['Column_Name_2'] == 2)
]
# returns a df with only rows with:
# Column_Name_1 equaling 1 
# or Column_Name_2 equaling 2

# It is important to note that you can only do basic operations 
# if you choose to query this way
# there is also the df.query(query_str) too with its own syntax

df_queried= df.query('Column_Name_1 == 1 & Column_Name_2 ==2')

# does the same thing as 

df_queried= df[
  (  df['Column_Name_1'] == 1)
  & (df['Column_Name_2'] == 2)
]

# you can also denote outside variables with quyery by doing

name= 'Bob'
df_queried= df.query('Column_Name_2 ==@name') 
# returns a df with rows with:
# Column_Name_2 equaling name which by extension is 'Bob'

# However be weary as you using nonlocal variables will lead to unexpected behavior
# the below code will fail

def outer():
    name = 'Bob'
    def inner():
        # May raise NameError: name 'name' is not defined
        return df.query("Name == @name")
    return inner()

outer()

# also if a column name has a space you can put the column name between `` to tell the query string its referring to a column

# For more advanced querying it is recommended using the apply method
# on the df that passes in a function as the parameter
# with axis being set to 1 so it applies the function
# row by row rather than column by column
# all that needs to be passed is a pd.Series that has only True or False values

var_1 = 1

def filter_function(row):
    return row["Column_Name_1"] == "Something" and row["Column_Name_2"] >=  var_1

df[
  df.apply(
    filter_function,
    axis= 1
  )
]
for more info and optional arguments refer to https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.query.html
Make a new DataFrame with Certain Selected Columns
Pandas allows the users to create a new DataFrame that take specific columns from another DataFrame while retaining the data in the specified order
df1 =pd.read_csv('SomeData.csv', index_col=False)
df2= df1[['Column_Name_1', 'Column_Name_3' , 'Column_Name_6']]
Dropping Columns
Pandas allows the user to easily drop columns of a DataFrame
df = df.drop(columns= {'Column_Name_1', 'Column_Name_2', 'Column_Name_3' ....})

#Another valid way to accomplish this is to do the below, 
#this method makes it so you do not have reassign #df

df.drop(columns= {'Column_Name_1', 'Column_Name_2', 'Column_Name_3' ....}, inplace=True)
for more info and optional arguments refer to https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.drop.html
Export the DataFrame
Pandas allows the user to easily export a DataFrame into many file formats such as xlsx, xml, csv, and even to your clipboard

df.to_csv('csv_file_path', index=False)
# to export to csv

df.to_excel('excel_file_path', index=False)
# to export to xlsx or xls or any excel format

df.to_xml('xml_file_path')
# to export to xml format

df.to_parquet('parquet_file_path', index=False)
# to export to pqt format

df.to_json('json_file_path', index=False)
# to export to json format

df.to_html('html_file_path', index=False)
# to export to html format

df.to_clipboard(index=False)
# to copy it to your clipboard, you can paste it in excel to see the data
In this problem though we are exporting to a csv

Author's note
It is highly discouraged to use for loops and df.iterrows() for this problem as doing so does not take advantage of builtin optimizations, but you can if you want, but I will be sad :C
Use / instead of \\ for paths when using pd.read_csv(directory)
